# GeoScope

GeoScope is a deep learning framework for image geolocalization that employs CNN transfer learning and a CLIP-inspired vision-language model to classify street view images into geographic regions. 

<!--
GeoScope is a deep learning framework for image geolocalization. The project leverages two complementary approaches:

- **CNN-Based Geolocalization:** Utilizing CNN architectures such as ResNet-18 and WideResNet via transfer learning, GeoScope classifies images into discrete geographic regions (e.g., regions or continents) using geotagged street view images.

- **Lite StreetCLIP-Inspired Model:** Adapting a lightweight version of the CLIP model, this approach leverages contrastive learning on image–caption pairs and synthetic captions derived from geographic labels. It enables robust zero-shot or few-shot predictions to improve generalization on unseen geographies.

## Overview

GeoScope addresses the challenge of image geolocalization—a problem with critical applications in photo tagging, search, and open-source intelligence—by mapping images to predefined geographic regions. By integrating transfer learning and vision-language models, GeoScope aims to overcome data scarcity and improve robustness to distribution shifts.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Model Approach:** Combines CNN-based classification with CLIP-inspired zero-shot learning.
- **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tuning on geotagged datasets for robust feature extraction.
- **Zero-Shot Generalization:** Leverages pretrained embeddings to predict geographic regions for unseen data.
- **Scalable & Diverse:** Designed to work across various environments from urban to rural scenes.
